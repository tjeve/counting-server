# Counting Server

The purpose of this min-project is to practice using a server. The Parameters of the project are listed below:

> Write a server that keeps track of a counter! Initialize a global variable that holds the count (starting at 0). Write three routes called POST /increment, POST /decrement, and GET /value. The first two should increment and decrement the value respectively and then respond with the new counter value. The third route should just respond with the current value. Again, verify that your server works with Postman.
